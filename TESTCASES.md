## Configuration Tips

You can adjust these values in `src/config/app.ts` to make testing easier:

| Setting                         | Default  | What it affects                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `pinCode`                       | 123456   | PIN for auth fallback               |
| `mockBalances.current`          | 73566.75 | Account balance shown               |
| `transferLimits.daily.used`     | 2000     | How much of daily limit is "used"   |
| `transferLimits.monthly.used`   | 15000    | How much of monthly limit is "used" |
| `transferLimits.perTransaction` | 6000     | Max single transfer amount          |
| `loadingDelay`                  | 800      | API response delay in ms            |
| `features.enableBiometrics`     | true     | Default state of Face ID toggle     |

Changes to config take effect on app reload - no rebuild needed.
